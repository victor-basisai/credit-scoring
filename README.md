# FEAT Fairness Methodology: Credit Scoring Assessment

This repository provide a Jupyter notebook and supporting code for the
credit scoring case study assessment in the FEAT Fairness Principles Assessment Case
Studies Document. Please see Section 3 of that document for the credit scoring
case study assessment itself.

It comes with **absolutely no warranty**.
It is not intended for use in production,

responsible Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) in the financial
services industry.
